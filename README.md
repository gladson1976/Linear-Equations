Solving linear equations using matrices

Enter the number of variables in the equation and then enter the equations in the provided textboxes in the below format..

x + 2y - z = -4<br />
2x + 3y - z = -11<br />
-2x +0y - 3z = 22<br />

The results will be displayed :)

x = -8<br />
y = 1<br />
z = -2
